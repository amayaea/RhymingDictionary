# RhymingDictionary
This is a very simple rhyming dictionary

I used JSoup to parse https://www.rhymedb.com/ to create a rhyming dictionary. 

The program prompts the user to enter a word and will return words that rhyme with the user's input. Inlcudes near rhymes. 
User also has the option to sort words by syllable count or alphabetically.
